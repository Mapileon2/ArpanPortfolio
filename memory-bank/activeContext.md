# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**

Setting up the backend API using Node.js and Express.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Created the `memory-bank` directory and core documentation files.

**Next Steps:**

*   Create a `backend` directory.
*   Initialize a Node.js project in the `backend` directory.
*   Install `express` and `cors` dependencies.
*   Create `index.js` in the `backend` directory.
*   Define API endpoints for projects, skills, testimonials, and contact information.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   Choosing a data storage solution: For simplicity, JSON files will be used initially.
*   API endpoint design: The API endpoints should be RESTful and easy to use.
*   Frontend data fetching: The frontend JavaScript code should efficiently fetch data from the API and update the HTML.

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

*   Use consistent naming conventions for files, directories, and variables.
*   Follow the principles of clean code and maintainability.
*   Document the code thoroughly.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

*   The initial static HTML structure provides a good foundation for the dynamic website.
*   The Ghibli-inspired design adds a unique and appealing aesthetic to the portfolio.
