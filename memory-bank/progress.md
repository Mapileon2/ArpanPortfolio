# Progress

**What Works:**

*   The basic HTML structure of the portfolio website is complete.
*   The website has a visually appealing Ghibli-inspired design.
*   The `memory-bank` directory and core documentation files have been created.

**What's Left to Build:**

*   Backend API using Node.js and Express.
*   API endpoints for projects, skills, testimonials, and contact information.
*   Data storage solution (JSON files).
*   Frontend JavaScript code to fetch data from the API and update the HTML.

**Current Status:**

The project is in the initial phase of development, focusing on setting up the backend API.

**Known Issues:**

*   The website content is currently static and requires manual updates.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

*   Initially, the website was a static HTML file. The decision was made to transform it into a dynamic application with a backend API to improve maintainability and scalability.
