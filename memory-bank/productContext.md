# Product Context

**Why This Project Exists:**

This project aims to enhance the maintainability and scalability of a personal portfolio website. By transitioning from a static HTML structure to a dynamic application with a backend API, the content can be updated more efficiently without requiring direct modifications to the HTML code.

**Problems It Solves:**

*   **Difficult Content Updates:** Static HTML requires manual editing of the code for every content change, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
*   **Limited Scalability:** Adding new sections or features to a static website can become complex and difficult to manage as the website grows.
*   **Lack of Interactivity:** Static websites offer limited возможности for user interaction and dynamic content display.

**How It Should Work:**

The dynamic portfolio website will consist of two main components:

*   **Backend API:** A Node.js and Express API will serve data for the website's content, including projects, skills, testimonials, and contact information. The data will be stored in JSON files.
*   **Frontend:** The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code will fetch data from the API and dynamically update the website's content.

**User Experience Goals:**

*   The website should load quickly and provide a seamless browsing experience.
*   The website should be visually appealing and maintain the Ghibli-inspired design.
*   The website should be easy to navigate and provide clear information about the portfolio owner's skills and experience.
